## Description

Introduction to Numerical Simulation is an introduction to computational techniques for the simulation of a large variety of engineering and engineered systems. Applications are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering, materials science, and operations research. Topics include: mathematical formulations; network problems; sparse direct and iterative matrix solution techniques; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; discretization methods for ordinary and partial differential equations; methods for the solution of integral equations; model-order reduction; and Monte Carlo techniques.

## Prerequisites
